# FiveM-Simple-IP-Lock

Simple code that alows you to lock a fivem script to an IP adress

Usage:
- Paste the code on the top of a lua script
- Replace "IP" with the desired IP address
- Replace "WEBHOOK" with the webhook link connected to the discord channel where you want your script logs
- Obfuscate the script (I recommend PSU -> https://discord.com/invite/psu)
